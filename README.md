# CROP_YILED_PREDICTION-MACHINE-LEARNING-WEB-APPLICATION
A Machine Learning model developed using the Random Forest Regressor(i.e For continous data) and developed web application using the HTML,CSS,JavaScript .And python FLASK which acts as a backend server side Scripting language
Crop-Yield-Prediction-Website
A website that predicts the probability of a CROP Yield taking pparameters as input as such Temperature,Humidity,Crop,Soil Type etc..

IMPORTANT MAKE SURE YOU HAVE ALREADY INSTALLED THESE LIBRARIES BEFORE RUNNING THE PROJECT

Make sure you have installed the python
Then install the required dependencies as
1.Numpy
2.Flask
3.Scikit-learn or sklearn
4.pandas
Instructions for Running the Server:

-->Change Your dataset path in model.py
-->First Run the Model.py using `python model.py' To create the(i.e we have already dumped our model in the pickle file) .pkl File
-->When you run the model file it will create an .pkl file name in out project folder
-->Then After successful run of the mdoel.py run the app.py file using `python app.py`.
-->Here in app.py change your dataset path and make sure the names for the files you create
-->Then Your project will run on the port 144.
