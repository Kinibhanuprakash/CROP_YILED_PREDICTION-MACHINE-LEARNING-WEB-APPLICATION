<h1><b>IMPORTANT MAKE SURE YOU HAVE ALREADY INSTALLED THESE LIBRARIES BEFORE RUNNING THE PROJECT</b><h1><br>
<h4>Make sure you have installed the python<br>
Then install the required dependencies as<br>
1.Numpy<br>
2.Flask<br>
3.Scikit-learn or sklearn<br>
4.pandas<br></h4>
<h4>Instructions for Running the Server:</h4><br>
<h6>-->Change Your dataset path in model.py <br>
-->First Run the Model.py using `python model.py' To create the(i.e we have already dumped our model in the pickle file) .pkl File <br>
-->When you run the model file it will create an .pkl file name in out project folder<br>
-->Then After successful run of the mdoel.py run the app.py file using `python app.py`.<br>
-->Here in app.py change your dataset path and make sure the names for the files you create<br>
-->Then Your project will run on the port 144.</h6>
